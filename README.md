## How I worked on this project

Well, hello. First, I implemented the original design in Figma. This helped me a lot in coding. Then, with the help of my dear friend React, I worked on the design of the components, and then on the flow of the app and the connection of the components to the states, and then the final test and publishing of the app.

## Why I build this project anyway

My goal in the end was to practice and increase my frontend skills. But well, I am a fan of films, especially the criminal and philosophical genres. In general, my goal was to show different types of films.

</br>

## If I had more time I would change this

If I had extra time, I would try to rewrite the app with a react router, and of course, with Zustand, I would try to write separately for each part of the store and work on its performance. try handle Movie cards to render the components ten to ten, not all together .
